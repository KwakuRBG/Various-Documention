Support for regular expressions (RE).

This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those
found in Perl. It supports both 8-bit and Unicode strings; both the pattern and
the strings being processed can contain null bytes and characters outside the
US ASCII range.

Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Most
ordinary characters, like "A", "a", or "0", are the simplest regular
expressions; they simply match themselves. You can concatenate ordinary
characters, so last matches the string 'last'.

There are a few differences between the old (legacy) behaviour and the new
(enhanced) behaviour, which are indicated by VERSION0 or VERSION1.

The special characters are:

| Value                 | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "."                   | Matches any character except a newline.                                                                                                                                                        |
| "^"                   | Matches the start of the string.                                                                                                                                                               |
| "$"                   | Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string.                                                                                                             |
| "*"                   | Matches 0 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE. Greedy means that it will match as many repetitions as possible.                                                                   |

| (?&#124;...&#124;...) | (?&#124;A&#124;B), creates an RE that will match either A or B, but reuses capture group numbers across the alternatives.                                                                      |
| (*FAIL)               | Forces matching to fail, which means immediate backtracking.                                                                                                                                   |

| (*PRUNE)              | Discards the current backtracking information. Its effect doesn't extend outside an atomic group or a lookaround.                                                                              |
| (*SKIP)               | Similar to (*PRUNE), except that it also sets where in the text the next attempt at matching the entire pattern will start. Its effect doesn't extend outside an atomic group or a lookaround. |

The fuzzy matching constraints are: "i" to permit insertions, "d" to permit
deletions, "s" to permit substitutions, "e" to permit any of these. Limits are
optional with "<=" and "<". If any type of error is provided then any type not
provided is not permitted.

A cost equation may be provided.

Examples:

`(?:fuzzy){i<=2}`

`(?:fuzzy){i<=1,s<=2,d<=1,1i+1s+1d<3}`

VERSION1: Set operators are supported, and a set can include nested sets. The
set operators, in order of increasing precedence, are:

| Value        | Definition                                                                     |
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| &#124;&#124; | Set union ("x&#124;&#124;y" means "x or y").                                   |
| ~~           | (double tilde) Symmetric set difference ("x~~y" means "x or y, but not both"). |
| &&           | Set intersection ("x&&y" means "x and y").                                     |
| --           | (double dash) Set difference ("x--y" means "x but not y").                     |

Implicit union, ie, simple juxtaposition like in [ab], has the highest
precedence.

VERSION0 and VERSION1:
The special sequences consist of "\\" and a character from the list below. If
the ordinary character is not on the list, then the resulting RE will match the
second character.

| Value          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Most of the functions support a concurrent parameter: if True, the GIL will be
released during matching, allowing other Python threads to run concurrently. If
the string changes during matching, the behaviour is undefined. This parameter
is not needed when working on the builtin (immutable) string classes.

Some functions in this module take flags as optional parameters. Most of
these flags can also be set within an RE:
